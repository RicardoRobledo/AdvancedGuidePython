# There are in fact two ways of working with the turtle module; one is to use
# the classes available with the library and the other
# is to use a simpler set of functions that hide the classes and objects

import turtle

# set a title for your canvas window
turtle.title('My Turtle Animation')
# set up the screen size (in pixels)
# set the starting point of the turtle (0, 0)
turtle.setup(width=200, height=200, startx=500, starty=300)
# sets the pen color to red
turtle.pencolor('blue')

# Hide cursor
turtle.hideturtle()

# Draw a square
turtle.forward(50)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(50)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(50)
